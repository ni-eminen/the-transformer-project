## Project Components

### 1. The Perceptron
   - Just a perceptron, a single neuron capable of binary classification.
   - Provides a foundational understanding of feedforward neural networks.
   - Implementation includes weights, activation functions, loss functions, bias terms, and backpropagationâ€”all from scratch.

### 2. A Multi-Layer Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
   - Explores the workings of larger neural networks.
   - Focuses on the implementation of backpropagation within a broader network context.

### 3. A Transformer
   - Minimal implementation based on "Attention Is All You Need."
   - A hands-on approach to understanding attention mechanisms and transformer structures from the ground up.
